	abstract = {GitHub provides the environment for developing and publishing website in integrated environment. By GitHub Pages, we can host the static web easy, fast and free. It helps the developer for integrating development and deployment process, because GitHub Pages is integrating with GitHub environment that support continuous integration and continuous delivery, and also become a content delivery network (CDN), as a part of JAMstack building block. Unfortunately, the usage GitHub as web hosting and JAMstack as an approach for developing web is not very popular among developer in Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to show how implement the JAMstack approach on designing and building website and host it on the GitHub. The website we designed using JAMstack approach by implementing Hugo as static site generator (SSG) and GitHub as content delivery network (CDN). We also insert API for showing the easiness of integrating lots of components on JAMstack approach. We do several tests to check the quality of the website, such as functional test and performance test. The performance test results show that Google PageSpeed score is 97% (A) and YSlow score is 91% (A). It shows that the website can run in good performance although it connected with others services through API.}
